   <h2>Today i learned about react</h2>
   <p>Today i learn the basics of react firstly 
    i learned how to create react project, basically
     we can create react project through 2 method No. 1
      is npx create-react-app app-name , then run through npm run
       start and No. 2 is npm create vite@latest, then enter your project name, 
       then select the library(react) then select the language(Javascript), hit enter,
        after creation of project now its time to run the project so write npm run dev in
         terminal and your project will run</p>
